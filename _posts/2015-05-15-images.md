Hello and welcome to this blog. My name is Ana, a senior undergradute biomedical engineering student who is trying to be introduced to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence! By writing a blog I am trying to make a commitment to myself, challenge myself to publish whatever I write and (hopefully) sharing something useful.

I am also trying to discover my own writing style and find a way to keep myselg accountable for keeping track of my progress. 

So, let's do this. 

<!--
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

Images can be made zoomable.
Simply add `data-zoomable` to `<img>` tags that you want to make zoomable.
