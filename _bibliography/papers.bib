abstract = {Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) offer an accessible means to capture dynamic movements, paving the way to obtain biomechanical analyses across diverse tasks1. IMU-based data analysis methods extensively depend on the quality of the data and have been developed and validated for specific tasks under controlled conditions, which may limit their generalizability. In contrast, foundational models that are able to  leverage data, provide an opportunity to use existing IMU data recorded during different tasks and apply it to a new task. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing a foundational model to detect task-specific biomechanical parameters from IMU readout  recorded during a wide range of activities.},

abstract = {Weaving is a fabrication process that is grounded in mathematics and engineering: from the binary, matrix-like nature of the pattern drafts weavers have used for centuries, to the punch card programming of the first Jacquard looms. This intersection of disciplines provides an opportunity to ground abstract mathematical concepts in a concrete and embodied art, viewing this textile art through the lens of engineering. Currently, available looms are not optimized to take advantage of this opportunity to increase mathematics learning by providing hands-on interdisciplinary learning in collegiate classrooms. In this work, we present SPEERLoom: an open-source, robotic Jacquard loom kit designed to be a tool for interweaving cloth fabrication, mathematics, and engineering to support interdisciplinary learning in the classroom. We discuss the design requirements and subsequent design of SPEERLoom. We also present the results of a pilot study in a post-secondary class finding that SPEERLoom supports hands-on, interdisciplinary learning of math, engineering, and textiles.},

  abstract={Currently available devices for blind computer users rely heavily on audio feedback, braille translation making digital interactions complex and time consuming.  In this paper we propose a new approach to enhance interpretability of digital data visualization for individuals with visual impairments. Our approach is to leverage haptic feedback and repurpose the computer mouse into an inclusive resource that allows blind users to navigate graphical data easily. The inherent points of contact on the hand facilitated by the mouse provide the means to overcome limitations encountered by existing haptic devices, enabling exploration of multiple sensory modalities while promoting kinesthetic exploration. By integrating haptic feedback into a common handheld device, we pave the way for a more equitable digital experience, enabling efficient extraction of essential information from graphics.},

  abstract={ This paper introduces the design of a novel three stage tensioning mechanism for an open source, automated, Jacquard table loom designed specifically for educational applications that can be assembled by students. Our aim is to motivate and concretize learning in math, computational thinking, and robotics through craft practices and hands-on learning activities associated with weaving. To be able to relate math concepts to weaving patterns, it is important for students to be able to create distinguishable high quality patterns. To produce such high quality cloth, uniform tension in the warp threads needs to be maintained throughout the weaving process. In this work we propose the design of a tensioning mechanism that allows for individual thread tension force adjustment and measurement during the weaving process. This mechanism provides a unique approach in the application of spring, friction, and normal forces in order to maintain uniform tension throughout the cloth.},
