Technology has been an excellent tool to be in touch with people around the globe, but lately it has heavenly influenced our attention span and interactions towards the outside world. In this way, \textit{Mynd Music} is a smell-enhanced virtual experience, along with real time EEG acquisition, that offers a nuanced understanding of our emotions and expression of them. During this art installation, the participant uses two EEG headsets -Muse 2, and Enophone- while being immersed in a virtual reality environment visiting different scenarios with their own scented stimuli -produced by Aroma Shooter®- to induce an emotional reaction. Meanwhile, the EEG signal is processed using frontal alpha asymmetry, along with relative beta and alpha power to correlate the readings with emotional states such as concentration, relaxation, and approach/avoidance oriented behaviors. The music is selected with machine learning algorithms to resemble the emotional state. Thus, the final melody is unique in every interaction with the VR environment, as our brain has different reactions. This diversity allows for exploration, communication, and understanding of our emotions in a way words can not express, but can be captured by a melody.  \textit{Mynd Music} is an acoustic re-interpretation of the physiological manifestation of an emotional state.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
