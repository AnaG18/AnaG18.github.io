Hands-On educational activities have shown potential in helping students concretize abstract concepts by connecting them to the physical world. In this project we aim to teach math and robotics principles from an artistâ€™s perspective through the use of weaving and a robotic loom. Simple weaving offers many possibilities for exploring concepts in geometry, set theory, and linear algebra. 

The objective was to design a tensioning mechanism which maintains uniform tension amongst threads whilst allowing for adjustments as one weaves.
