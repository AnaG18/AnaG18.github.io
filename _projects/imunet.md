The use of wearable sensors to monitor kinematics represents a promising opportunity for natural environment assessments in biomechanics. Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) are practical and accessible options to capture human movement in and out-of-lab settings, however, their readouts have been validated and developed under controlled conditions that are not generalizable across tasks.

The recent rise of deep learning models has shown a powerful capacity for unraveling complex patterns in data across different domains -ranging from image, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, their performance in IMU-driven biomechanical assessments has not been fully explored, mostly due to large amounts of labeled data required to feed the models.

The objective of this project is to study the feasibility of a generalized deep learning model that leverages IMU data for biomechanical estimation across different activities, particularly for tasks with limited data.
